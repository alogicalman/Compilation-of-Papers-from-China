# China Cognitive Domain Operations & Intelligent Warfare Research Repository

## Overview

This repository curates and classifies hundreds of Chinese-language and translated documents related to **Cognitive Domain Operations (CDO)**, **Intelligent Warfare**, **Algorithmic Cognitive Warfare**, **Political and Ideological Work**, **Media Convergence**, and the PLA’s evolving theories of non-kinetic war.

It includes primary sources from:
- PLA Military Journals
- Chinese State-Backed Academic Publications
- Party-Theory Sources (e.g., People’s Forum, Guangming Daily)
- Cybersecurity/InfoSec Sites (e.g., Security Insider)
- Government Think Tanks and Research Networks (e.g., China Social Science Network)

This dataset supports deep research into the CCP’s cognitive warfare doctrine, enabling **rigorous analysis**, **machine-readable metadata creation**, and **integration with RAG-based systems** for policy, academic, and OSINT use.
